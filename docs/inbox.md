## Can I communicate directly with a customer?
You are able to interact with your customers directly and receive their reactions through [Two-way SMS.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/solutions/two-way-sms/)

To use two-way SMS, you must choose the correct [sender ID type](sender-type.md#what-is-a-sender-type-and-how-can-i-use-it) in the second step of SMS campaign or third step of Smart SMS campaign, respectively.

However, be aware that two-way SMS may not be supported in your country and/or by a specific sender ID type. To see whether your designated country and/or sender ID type supports two-way communication, [see our pricelist.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-price/)

## Where can I see a response from my customer?
If you selected one of the [sender ID types](sender-type.md#what-is-a-sender-type-and-how-can-i-use-it) that supports two-way SMS communication with your customers in your designated country ([see the pricelist to make sure it is the case](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-price/)), you can see their responses in: 

- **Inbox (in the menu)**
    - Your customers‘ responses to your message go to Inbox when you use one of the following sender ID type: System number or Short code

-	**Your mobile phone inbox**
    - Your customers‘ responses to your message go to your mobile phone inbox when you use: Own number sender ID

`Text sender ID is not supported for Two-way SMS communication.`
