## I have my contact numbers in national format only.
If you’re [importing your contacts to Address book](#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-address-book) or [a campaign](#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-my-campaign) via CSV/Excel or vCard, you need to select a country where your contacts are situated. It is because we need to know where to send your messages to. 

BulkGate automatically adds a prefix e.g. +44, according to your selected country, to all numbers in national format e.g. 01632 960850, resulting in e.g. +44 1632 960850.

## I have my contact numbers in both national and international formats.
If you’re uploading your contacts to Address book or a campaign via CSV/Excel or vCard, you need to select a country where your contacts are situated. It is because we need to know where to send your messages to. 

You might have a blend of both nationally and internationally formatted numbers. In this case, BulkGate will automatically add a prefix e.g. +44 to nationally formatted numbers e.g. 01632 960850 according to the selected country, and leave all internationally formatted numbers with prefix (e.g. +44 or other) in their original form.
