## What are sending restrictions?
In your campaign, you are able to set up how many SMS messages you want to send each day. This is especially intended for our customers that have high volume campaigns and wish to split their traffic in several days for various reasons. 
One of the most common reasons is that you want to be able to handle all your customersâ€™ needs sufficiently. If you would send all your messages in one day, it could overwhelm your customer support.
