## What is Flash SMS?
A Flash SMS is a message that pops-up directly on the recipient’s main screen without the recipient’s need to go to the mobile phone inbox to read the message. Flash SMS is useful when you need to catch the recipient’s attention immediately. Common examples of Flash SMS usage can be emergency alerts, traffic alerts and others.

Unlike a normal text message, a Flash SMS is not routed to the recipient’s message inbox where is stored. After being dismissed by the recipient it is usually gone.
