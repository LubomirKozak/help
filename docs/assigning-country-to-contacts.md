## I have my contact numbers in national format only.
If you’re uploading your contacts to address book or a campaign via [CSV/Excel](importing-contacts-excel.md#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-address-book-via-csvexcel) or [vCard,](importing-contacts-via-vcard.md#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-address-book-via-vcard) you need to select a country (therefore a prefix) where your contacts are situated. It is because we need to know where to send your messages to. 

>BulkGate automatically adds a prefix e.g. +44, according to your selected country, to all numbers in national format e.g. 01632 960850, resulting in e.g. +44 1632 960850. 

## I have my contact numbers in both national and international formats.
If you’re uploading your contacts to address book or a campaign via [CSV/Excel](importing-contacts-excel.md#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-address-book-via-csvexcel) or [vCard,](importing-contacts-via-vcard.md#how-do-i-import-contacts-to-address-book-via-vcard) you need to select a country (therefore a prefix) where your contacts are situated. It is because we need to know where to send your messages to. 

You might have a mix of both nationally and internationally formatted numbers in your file with contacts. In this case, BulkGate will automatically add a prefix e.g. +44 to nationally formatted numbers (e.g. 01632 960850) according to the selected country, and leave all internationally formatted numbers with prefix (e.g. +44 or other) in their original form. So don’t worry, all your SMS messages will reach their right destination.
