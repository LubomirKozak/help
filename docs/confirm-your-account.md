## How do I finish creating my BulkGate account and confirm my email?
To finish creating an account, you need to confirm that you own the email that you used to create the account:
-	To confirm your email, click on the activation link in the email you received from BulkGate when you created the account. [Learn what to do if you can't find the email](#i-cant-find-my-bulkgate-registration-confirmation-email)

## I can't find my BulkGate registration confirmation email.
If you created a BulkGate account with an email, we sent an activation link to that email. If you can't find your confirmation email:
-	Check your spam or junk mail folder
-	Try adding noreply (at) bulkgate.com to your address book to see if you can find the confirmation email
-	If you still don't see the email, please contact us on **support (at) topefekt.com**
