## How can I personalize my campaign?
You are able to personalize your campaign while typing a message in the [second step of SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate) or [third step of Smart SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-smart-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate), respectively.

Personalizing your message is a powerful tool that creates a higher positive attitude towards the message from the side of the recipient. This can therefore lead to a higher conversion rate of the campaign. 

In order to personalize your campaign in BulkGate you have to have necessary information such as name, email or other contact information.

To personalize your campaign:
1.	Go to the [second step of SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate) or [third step of Smart SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-smart-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate), respectively
2.	Unwrap Personalize menu under the typing window
3.	Use any of the available options in this menu in order to personalize your campaign. Note, however, that this menu has two sides. The upper one represents contact information you inserted to BulkGate. The lower one represents your personal information

## What is a sender type and how can I use it?
You, as a sender who initiates a message, have different options how to present yourself to your customers, staff and others – recipients. In other words, when a recipient opens your message, he/she will immediately see who sent the message.

BulkGate has 4 types of sender, however not all of them can be available in your country.

**`System Number`** is a phone number that you as a sender can‘t influence and your recipient will therefore receive your message from a phone number generated by Bulkgate.

**`Short code`** is a short phone number that you as a sender can't influence and your recipient will therefore receive your message from a short number generated by Bulkgate (e.g. 2576).

**`Text sender ID`** allows you to choose your own phone number which is subsequently displayed in the delivered SMS to your recipient. Recipient can reply to your message on this number. 
This sender type can be used for [two-way SMS messaging.]( https://www.bulkgate.com/en/solutions/two-way-sms/) 

**`Own Number Sender ID`** allows you to select a unique text, e.g. company name that appears instead of a phone number (e.g. MyShop.com, Amazon.com). The maximum number of characters is 11. 

## What is Unicode?
When you activate Unicode in your campaign, it allows you to use characters outside of the [standard GSM character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38) that are most commonly used in mobile communications. Unicode can therefore use the standard GSM character set and character sets that are common in Arabic, Chinese and other languages altogether. 

When typing a message in BulkGate, a warning “Activate UNICODE to display the message correctly” shows up if your characters are outside of the standard GSM character set. This message could be illegible to a recipient if you would not activate Unicode.

When you activate Unicode in your campaign, 1 message is limited to 70 characters as opposed to 160 in the standard SMS.


## What is Flash SMS?
A Flash SMS is a message that pops-up directly on the recipient’s main screen without the recipient’s need to go to the mobile phone inbox to read the message. Flash SMS is useful when you need to catch the recipient’s attention immediately. Common examples of Flash SMS usage can be emergency alerts, traffic alerts and others.

Unlike a normal text message, a Flash SMS is not routed to the recipient’s message inbox where is stored. After being dismissed by the recipient it is usually gone.

## What are sending restrictions?
In your campaign, you are able to set up how many SMS messages you want to send each day. This is especially intended for our customers that have high volume campaigns and wish to split their traffic in several days for various reasons. 
One of the most common reasons is that you want to be able to handle all your customers’ needs sufficiently, but if you would send all your messages in one day, it could overwhelm your customer support.

## How to schedule my campaign and set a correct time and date?
In your campaign, you can either send all your messages immediately after you click Send at the end a campaign, [set sending restrictions](#what-are-sending-restrictions), or set a schedule for your campaign.

To set a schedule for a campaign:
1.	Reach the [second step of SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate) or [third step of Smart SMS campaign](#how-do-i-create-and-send-smart-sms-campaign-on-bulkgate), respectively
2.	Click on Schedule Sending
3.	Set up date and time when you want to send your campaign
4.	Select a time zone according to which is the previous step oriented

1.	Click on Messaging in left side menu
