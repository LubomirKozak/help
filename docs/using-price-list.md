## How to use price list?
It is always good to know SMS price in a country where you want to send SMS campaign to. [BulkGate price list](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/pricing/) gives you a total overview of how much SMS cost for every [sender ID type](building-and-sending-campaigns.md#what-is-a-sender-type-and-how-can-i-use-it) and operator in every country we operate. Additionally, you can see whether the specific sender ID type allows you to have [two-way communication](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/solutions/two-way-sms/) with your customers, whether you need to register a specific sender type first and what the costs are.

It also lets you [calculate](#how-to-use-price-calculator) how much you will pay for your upcoming SMS campaign and SMS notifications, and shows you bonus offers that you can reach.

Lastly, you can click More information on the bottom of the price list to see:
-	Additional information about sender types and examples
-	Any notes about sender types and operators in the selected country

## What are payment levels?
When you are in the [price list](using-price-list.md#how-to-use-price-list), you may notice an item next to a country selection. This is a payment level selection. When you select a different payment level, the SMS price changes. Each payment level has its lower and upper price limit, and its own discounts. If you therefore decide to [buy credits](purchasing-credit.md#how-can-i-buy-credits), it is worth checking individual price levels. The higher the price level (higher payment amount), the lower the price of SMS is. 

Please notice that the Credit/SMS amount does not change when you change the payment level. It is because SMS always costs the same in terms of credits. However, when you select higher price level, your SMS price will be lower.
