## How to use price list?
It is always good to know SMS price in a country where you want to send SMS campaign to. [BulkGate price list](https://www.bulkgate.com/en) gives you a total overview of how much SMS cost for every [sender ID type](building-and-sending-campaigns.md#what-is-a-sender-type-and-how-can-i-use-it) and network in every country we operate.

## What are payment levels?
When you are in the [price list](using-price-list.md#how-to-use-price-list), you may notice an item next to a country selection. This is a payment level selection. When you select a different payment level, the SMS price changes. Each payment level has its lower and upper price limit, and its own discounts. If you therefore decide to [buy credits](purchasing-credit.md#how-can-i-buy-credits), it is worth checking individual price levels. The higher the price level (higher payment amount), the lower the price of SMS is. 

Please notice that the Credit/SMS amount does not change when you change the payment level. It is because SMS always costs the same in terms of credits. However, when you select higher price level, your SMS price will be lower.
