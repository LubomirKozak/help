## How to use price list?
Credits are a virtual currency at [BulkGate Portal.](https://www.bulkgate.com/en/sms-portal/) If you want to create SMS campaign for example, you must have a sufficient balance of credits on your account first. See [how to buy credits.](#31) Also, before you buy credits, check the [price list](#22) and calculate your next campaign cost. 

## What are payment levels?
When you are in the [price list](#22), you may notice an item next to a country selection. This is a selection for payment level. When you select a different payment level, the SMS price changes. Each payment level has its lower and upper price limit, and its own discounts. If you therefore decide to [buy credits](#31), it is worth checking individual price levels. The higher the price level (higher payment amount), the lower the price of SMS is. 

Please notice that the Credit/SMS amount does not change when you change the payment level. It is because SMS always costs the same in terms of credits. However, when you select higher price level, your SMS price will be lower.

## How to use price calculator?
Price calculator helps you see how much you will pay for your SMS campaign, or how many SMS messages you will be able to send after you enter the amount you want to spend. 
Price calculator can also suggest discounted offers based on [payment levels,](#34) so you spend less money on your campaigns.
