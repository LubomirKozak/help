## What is a sender type and how can I use it?
You, as a sender who initiates the communication, have different options how to present yourself to your customers, staff and others. In other words, when a recipient opens your message, he/she will immediately see who sent the message.

BulkGate has 4 types of sender, however `some of them might not be available in your country.`

**`System Number`** is a phone number that you as a sender can‘t influence. Your recipient will therefore receive your message from a phone number generated by Bulkgate. (je to číslo ve formatu dané země?)

**`Short code`** is a short phone number that you as a sender can't influence and your recipient will therefore receive your message from a short number generated by Bulkgate (e.g. 2576).

**`Text sender ID`** allows you to use a unique text, e.g. company name that appears instead of a phone number (e.g. MyShop.com, Amazon.com). The maximum number of characters is 11.

**`Own Number Sender ID`** allows you to use your own phone number which is subsequently displayed in the delivered SMS to your recipient. Recipient can reply to your message on this number.
