## How can I assign a business page to an offer?
Every offer is placed on a business page. If you have more than one business page you need to select where your offer will be placed. So it is important to assign the right business page for your offer.

To assign a business page to an offer:
1.	Go to the second step of Smart SMS campaign
2.	Assign a business page to your offer in the Business page menu

`Note, however, that you cannot change assigned business page after it has been sent out.`
